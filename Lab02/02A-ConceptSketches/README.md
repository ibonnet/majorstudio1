# 02A: Concept & Sketches

<i><b>Goals:</b> After reviewing the data and data set imagine 3 different qualitative visualization concepts. For each concept, create a hand-drawn sketch and write a paragraph about the idea.

The sketch really should be hand-drawn, not done with a computer. Please design it for a format of 16:9 and make it self explanatory, so that I can understand what I am looking at even without your explanation.
The paragraph should include:
- Title of the visualization (what am I looking at)
- What are questions that you want to explore with this visualization?
- Which qualitative dataset is used? 
- What are the properties of the data set? How many data points, what's the quality of the data etc?
- Which visualization method is used and why?

Please bring these items to class in physical form, either hand-drawn or printed, so we can pin them on the wall and review them together again. In addition, research and find 1-3 Inspirational examples of successful qualitative visualizations that you especially like and post them on slack. Write briefly why you think your examples are relevant and a good inspiration. </i>

## Assignment

This is not the story of a video going viral nor the one of an unprecedented event that shocked many. This is the story of a widespread, repeated and accepted violation of people’s human rights in Cote d’Ivoire.

Alassane Ouattara is the first president to govern after years of political instability and civil wars
in Cote d’Ivoire. But since he first took power in 2011, there has been an increase of house demolitions and forced evictions in the country. For some, destruction is all he represents.

### Map of Abidjan since 2011

As we slide through this, we can see new locations where neighborhoods have been razed to the ground over time. Each dot represents a house demolition that has been identified using open-source investigation tools.

### Satellite imagery of house destructions

As we scroll down, the image before house destructions will be replaced by the image of the aftermath from the same geolocation. House demolitions can be seen through satellite imagery.

### Timeline of house destructions

The main targets are local markets and marginalized neighborhoods. Though some recent house destructions were done to build new projects such as a metro and two bridges, the reason for demolishing most households remains unknown. According to the UNHRW, “forced evictions are a gross violation of human rights, in particular the right to adequate housing” (Resolution 1993/77).

1. The government announces a new construction plan
2. Residents receive an informal notice to leave their houses. Sometimes, they are given 24 hours, sometimes, no notice is given prior to the eviction.
3. The eviction is postponed.
4. In only a few cases, the population receives little compensation (the equivalent of $20 to $100)
5. Residents wake up with the smell of tear gas early in the morning, officers tell the population to go out of their houses and they don’t give them the time to take their belongings.
6. Residents need to find a new place to live, a new school for their kids, and often a new job.
7. If nothing is built on top of the ruins, the population comes back to sleep in the ruins.
