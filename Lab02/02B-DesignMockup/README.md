# Design mockup and code prototype

<i><b>Goals:</b> After the first design review, decide for one of the concepts for this assignment. You now have two parallel work streams: Design and code. For this assignment create a prototype for both:</i>

## Design mockup

<i><b>Goals:</b> Create a high fidelity version of the design you want to create
Include the data visualization, a title, a legend and any relevant scales or additional information
Carefully consider colors, scale, composition and typography. Be able to answer why you picked any of the above. All designs should be created with a 16:9 aspect ratio in mind (1920x1080px) </i>

### Timeline

A timeline will appear in the first page with the details from a specific event where houses were destroyed in Abidjan.

### Before and after

Two satellite images overlap and we can swipe from left to right to see the before and after the house destruction from the event described in the timeline.

### Interactive map

I will add an interactive map where we can see the dots appearing depending on the year.

## Code Prototype

<i><b>Goals:</b> Gather all the data you want to use or build a system to query it using the api
Make sure the data is structured in the right way for your visualization. Build a prototype that loads the data and displays it visually on the screen. Imagine a plan to get to your high fidelity mockup in code </i>
