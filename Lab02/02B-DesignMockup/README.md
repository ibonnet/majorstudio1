# Design mockup and code prototype

<i><b>Goals:</b> After the first design review, decide for one of the concepts for this assignment. You now have two parallel work streams: Design and code. For this assignment create a prototype for both:</i>

## Design mockup

<i><b>Goals:</b> Create a high fidelity version of the design you want to create
Include the data visualization, a title, a legend and any relevant scales or additional information
Carefully consider colors, scale, composition and typography. Be able to answer why you picked any of the above. All designs should be created with a 16:9 aspect ratio in mind (1920x1080px) </i>

## Code Prototype

<i><b>Goals:</b> Gather all the data you want to use or build a system to query it using the api
Make sure the data is structured in the right way for your visualization. Build a prototype that loads the data and displays it visually on the screen. Imagine a plan to get to your high fidelity mockup in code </i>
