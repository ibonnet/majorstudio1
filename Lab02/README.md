# Lab 02: Qualitative Data

<i><b>Learning Goals:</b>The second segment of the course will introduce the concept of qualitative data and how it can be
represented. Students will explore manually-created design alternatives to sample data sets and
examine how those solutions effectively communicate the content, as well as present a narrative
context for the recipient. Students will be given a data set and will design a static visualization of the
content for a proposed intended audience. Through the exercise, students will explore the most
effective way to communicate the information. Group discussion and critique of the work will
examine best practices.</i>
