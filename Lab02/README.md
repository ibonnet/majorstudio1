# Lab 02: Qualitative Data

<i><b>Learning Goals:</b>The second segment of the course will introduce the concept of qualitative data and how it can be
represented. Students will explore manually-created design alternatives to sample data sets and
examine how those solutions effectively communicate the content, as well as present a narrative
context for the recipient. Students will be given a data set and will design a static visualization of the
content for a proposed intended audience. Through the exercise, students will explore the most
effective way to communicate the information. Group discussion and critique of the work will
examine best practices.</i>

## 02A: Concept & Sketches

<i><b>Goals:</b> After reviewing the data and data set imagine 3 different qualitative visualization concepts. For each concept, create a hand-drawn sketch and write a paragraph about the idea.

The sketch really should be hand-drawn, not done with a computer. Please design it for a format of 16:9 and make it self explanatory, so that I can understand what I am looking at even without your explanation.
The paragraph should include:
- Title of the visualization (what am I looking at)
- What are questions that you want to explore with this visualization?
- Which qualitative dataset is used? 
- What are the properties of the data set? How many data points, what's the quality of the data etc?
- Which visualization method is used and why?

Please bring these items to class in physical form, either hand-drawn or printed, so we can pin them on the wall and review them together again. In addition, research and find 1-3 Inspirational examples of successful qualitative visualizations that you especially like and post them on slack. Write briefly why you think your examples are relevant and a good inspiration. </i>
