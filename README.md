<b> Comments </b>
Change the data from total number of deaths by suicide to deaths per 100,000 people in each country.

### Code Prototype
I would like to do a "lollipop chart" with the countries' difference in deaths inside and outside prison using the code from <a href="https://d3-graph-gallery.com/graph/lollipop_basic.html">the d3 gallery here.</a>

If not, I would like to do something like the graphs in this article from <a href="https://www.themarshallproject.org/2021/06/23/millions-of-people-with-felonies-can-now-vote-most-don-t-know-it">The Marshall Project</a> where each dot represents the numbers of deaths by suicide in the US inside and outside prison. I experimented with Observable to compare countries around the world with the code that <a href="https://observablehq.com/@ibonnet/percentage-of-deaths-by-suicide-inside-prison-in-the-world-in-2019">can be found here.</a>
