# 1D â€” Final Design, Prototype and Presentation

In an attempt to illustrate the urgent need to provide adequate mental health aid and more humane conditions inside prison, I used data from the <a href="https://dataunodc.un.org/dp-prisons-persons-held">UN's Office on Drugs and Crime</a> and from the <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/suicide#800-000-people-die-from-suicide-every-year">Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Global Burden of Disease</a>, to compare deaths by suicide inside and outside prison facilities in 2019.

## Data description

Data from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation, Global Burden of Disease represents deaths by suicide per 100,000 individuals outside prison and data from the UN's Office on Drugs and Crime represents deaths by suicide and self-harm per 100,000 individuals inside prison. Both datasets are from 2019 and the countries that did not have data in either one were marked as missing values.

## Country selection

The US is the main focus of this assignment, although I have included countries where our classmates are from as reference, as well as Norway and Japan where deaths by suicide rates were low.
