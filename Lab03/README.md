# Lab 03: Dynamics, Interactivity and Narrative

<i><b>Learning Goals:</b>This segment of the course will introduce the design elements of dynamics and interactivity.
Students will gain an understanding of how these elements can be used to further communicate
meaning within data sets. Design exercises will introduce additional web-based tools to incorporate
dynamics and interactivity into new design explorations. Special emphasis will be placed on the
narrative that is generated by the user’s active exploration of the data, how their understanding of
the data is enhanced, and how the designer can effectively guide that journey. At the instructor’s
discretion, students may explore how crowdsourcing can be used to generate or filter the data.
Students will choose a data set in coordination with the instructor and design a dynamic or
interactive visualization of the content for an intended audience. Through the exercise, students will
explore the most effective way to animate the information. Group discussion and critique of the
design solutions will highlight best practices.</i>
